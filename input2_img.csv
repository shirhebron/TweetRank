@92supreme_cb,LMAOO “under qualified” Are you the one who hires them or something? Who are you to even judge how qualified writers? And you’re right. They’re not equal. One is a white man and the other is a woman of color. But she’s asian so I guess we can overlook this blatant racism.,0,10,1,,

@iIAx102,Nope. Writers get money for their quality not because they're CO-WRITERS. Literally one of the dumbest arguments is that everyone should get paid the same in every movie. This isn't some Starbucks job. There're no defined rules on how much a person should get paid.,1,14,1,,
